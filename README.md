# Sales Performance and Analytics

## Overview
This project aims to analyze and visualize the key insights and sales parameters for one of the top retail companies in the world. Dummy data has been used here to abide by the non-disclosure agreement with the client. Power BI has been used to process the data, create a database for easy management, explore the data visually, and gain valuable insights.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains dummy data as part of the non-disclosure agreement with the client. The dataset includes information related to sales, products, customers, budgets and time period (date, month, year).

## Data Processing
The data used here requires some preprocessing to clean and transform it into a suitable format for analysis. Power Query Editor within Power BI has been utilized to clean, filter, and transform the data as necessary. This ensures that the data used for the dashboard is accurate and reliable.

## Technologies Used
Power Query Editor: For data cleaning, filtering, and transformation into the database.

Microsoft Power BI: For data analysis and visualization.

## Key Highlights
